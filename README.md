# Drug-Design-using-VAE
Capstone Project assigned by Prof Ravi Kothari


Open ended project where we had to use FDA approved drugs dataset in SMILES format and generate new strings 

This project included feature engineering to filter out outliers and control length
encoding of the strings in a 30x31 maxtix 
and generated new strings that followed the smiles format and could be plotted using the rdkit.chem library
